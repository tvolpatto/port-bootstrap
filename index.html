                    <P>I was born in the south of Brazil and I moved to Utah 2 years ago. I have a
                            dog, his name is Esquilo, which means “squirrel” in English. We named him after the movie Up!
                            I’m a fan of sports, but mostly to watch. My favorite sport is soccer and I love watching all the
                            games, even the ones of small teams that nobody knows about.
                            I also love playing video games! I play every time I can, in my phone, in my computer, on TV...
                            I am very interested in aircrafts and dinosaurs. I enjoy listening to Podcasts about them and also
                            about curiosities, economy, geography and history. </P>

                        <p class="container-text-two"> I graduated in IT almost ten years ago and I have done some endorsements
                                since then, but I am very
                                excited with the opportunity to
                                refresh my skills and learn more in this course. One of the big challenges and goals that I have is
                                to develop my speaking skills in English, although I understand it very well, I know that I have to
                                work in my articulation abilities. I am looking forward to learn more about web development and work
                                with this.
                                I am a very patient and determined person and I believe these aspects will help me accomplish my
                                goals. </p>
